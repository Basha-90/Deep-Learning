Arthmatic mean

it is sensitive to extreme outliers, especially when the sample size is small.Therefore, it is not an appropriate measure of central tendency for skewed distribution. Mean cannot be calculated for nominal or nonnominal ordinal data. Even though mean can be calculated for numerical ordinal data, many times it does not give a meaningful value, e.g. stage of cancer.
